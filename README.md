# Food-Delivery-Application
Developed an application for IOS and Android devices that allows users to order food to their home using React Native, Tailwindcss, Nativewind, and Sanity API.

This application allows the user to order food to their house by making a selection from various different restaurant options. 

The Home Screen of the app is shown below.

Once a restaurant is selected, the user is directed into a screen with various different food options. Upon selection, a 'view cart' button appears displaying the order total.

Once the user selects view cart, the cart shows the different food items that have been selected as well as the quantity of items they have selected. Once the user is satisfied with their order they can press place order.

After they have placed their order, the user is directed to a map that shows the restaurants location, the estimated time for delivery, and two buttons. One button is to contact the driver, and the other button is to cancel the order.
