# Food-Delivery-Application
Developed an application for IOS and Android devices that allows users to order food to their home using React Native, Tailwindcss, Nativewind, and Sanity API.

This application allows the user to order food to their house by making a selection from various different restaurant options. 

The Home Screen of the app is shown below.
